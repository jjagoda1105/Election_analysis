## Overview and Purpose of Election Audit Project

The Election Result data provides us with election outcomes based on each voter’s ID. The raw data shows who each person voted for, and what county they were in. It is up to us to summarize this data, based on candidate and county votes, to determine who won the election. 

### Analysis of the Counties

## Election Audit Summary

In summary, the data was able to show us the voter turnout by county and the candidate winning results. This code can be reused again to evaluate election results in any election. Perhaps, in the next election we want to learn more information on why a candidate voted for who they did. We can look at factors like race, employment status, and age. 

We could use the code to create a race dictionary. The race dictionary could tell us how many people of that specific race came out to vote. A for loop would count the number of races and we would be able to see the percentage turnout by race. This could show us if the election was swayed based on the race of the voters. 

We could also use the code to iterate through employment status. To code this, we would create a for loop and count the number of employed and unemployed people. We could see if the employment status of the voters had any relation to the outcome of the candidates.
